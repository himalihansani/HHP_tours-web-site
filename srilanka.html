<span class="about-h1"><span class="bgcolor">SRI LANKA RISING</span></span>
With the end of the three decade long war Sri Lanka is seeing a sudden burst in infrastructure development and a of a new Sri Lanka rising. Today post-war Sri Lanka is seeing a rapid and wide spread infrastructure development within rural and urban areas as never seen in the country before.The island-wide road development program is at the center of this effort. The improved connectivity enabled by road development, particularly rural roads, generates significant economic and social returns. It is having a trans formative impact on the lives of people around the country. The completion of the highway network (commencing with the Southern Highway, Katunayake Expressway and Colombo Ring Road) will bring about significant cost-savings that will boost the competitiveness of the economy.<br /><br />

The rural electrification program has now extended power to 91% of the country’s households. It is bringing considerable benefits, particularly to poor and vulnerable households (not least through the improved environment for children’s studies). The completion of the much delayed Norochcholai coal power station has helped to avoid power cuts or recourse to hiring exceedingly expensive barges for thermal generation.<br /><br />

The rehabilitation of the railway network and rolling stock, combined with the road development, will increase mobility and help to contain transport costs which are an important determinant of an economy’s competitiveness. Port and airport development is also creating the potential for Sri Lanka to become a key transport and tourist/transit hub for  Asia. The completion of the Hambantota Port and the Colombo Southport Expansion will increase the capacity to take advantage of the country’s strategic location on the major international shipping lanes.<br /><br />
		
 	 	 
The growth of Indian trade and China’s appetite for natural resources from the Middle East and Africa creates the conditions for rapid expansion of activity in this sector. The second international airport at Mattala increases the potential for handling increased tourist arrivals and positioning Sri Lanka as a transit hub. Today Sri Lanka’s Bandaranayake International Airport (is the busiest airport in the country with more than 6 million passengers per year, Hambantota International airport in Mattala was declared opened in March, 2013 when Sri Lanka is celebrating a century in aviation.The domestic airports are scattered around the country in Ampara, Anuradhapura, Batticaloa, Ratmalana, Jaffna, Trincomalee and Wirawila creating an extensive network of domestic air traveling.<br /><br />


. With Endless beaches, timeless ruins, welcoming people, herds of elephants, killer surf, cheap prices, fun trains, famous tea, flavorful food, newly gained peace and improved infrastructure Sri Lanka had been repeatedly named the next tourist destination worth all the investments. Fueled by piles and piles of compliments as the best tourist destination in the world and with years of war behind it for good, Sri Lanka is rising and its time you dropped in.

Traveled to Sri Lanka with children in June 2015. Used the services of Miss. Himali (HHP Tours). Everything was professionally. For 5 days I visited Safari in the Yala national Park, tea plantations in the hills of Nuwara Eliya, temple of the Tooth relic in Kandy, climbed ancient Sigiriya and many more interesting places. My kids especially liked rafting, for them it was the first experience of rafting . I recommend an Ayurvedic massage at Habarana where we are on the way  with Himali. Shirodara relieves stress at all, very nice experience. Very good selection of hotels which booked by HHP Tours. It was reasonable price . Anyway, Himali is a great person, our time with her in Sri Lanka was interesting and informative. Thank you!

We would like to grateful tour guide Himali and tour company HHP Tours (Pvt)Ltd. We even two months before planned program of excursion with HHP Tours. We were offered accommodation options, excursions were chosen so that we could see the most interesting and memorable places in this paradise . For 5 days we visited a large number of beautiful places, especially ancient city of Annuradhapura, absolutely not a tourist place with a special atmosphere. I remember the botanical garden in Kandy. On the way we stopped to try the best pineapples, coconuts, mangoes, papayas, passion fruit. The night trek to the "Adam's Peak" left incredible impressions and wonderful photos. Himali very beautifully and fluently speaks Russian language; he is well educated and intelligent. At the end of our long tour we did a city tour in Colombo with Himali. On our next trip to Sri Lanka we will definitely turn to Himali. Thanks again. Alexey and Svetlana , November 2016.

Many thanks, Himali <HHP Tours> for a wonderful vacation. We started planning our trip back in April. Our vacation was on July 2017 and we sent a request to Miss. Himali. Himali responded immediately, we corrected The route, agreed on the price and began to prepare for the vacation. HHP Tours  gave us  good service. The guide Ruvan and the driver  Tushar, who came meet to us, at the sharp time. On the way to Sigiriya, Ruwan explained about lifestyle of Sri Lankan people. He studied in Moscow and speaks nicely Russian. He told funny stories about his life in Russia. As my husband and friends, too, former students of his college, we found many common topics for discus. The driver Tushar was a good and careful driver. On the way we always stopped and they helped to buy all the necessary things. I would like to express my special thanks for organizing the holiday. We are very satisfied with our journey and acquaintance with you. Thank you very much.

We planned a tour of Sri Lanka + Maldives. In Sri Lanka we had only 4.5 days, but as usual during this period I wanted to see everything as much as possible. There were several options, but only Himali arranged quickly answered questions (from the others the answers had to wait for 3-4 days), recommended how to adjust our route in time to see everything planned, and we were satisfied with the cost. His services was great  . I  noted that the punctuality of Himali, he always came on time and even asked us to hurry, because Places a lot and visit everywhere. I noted his excellent knowledge of English, answers all questions, interestingly tells about the country, places visited and history. Well organized tours. As he promised, the car was really comfortable and air-conditioned (it is extremely important). Finally most pleasant impressions of the country and the guide Himali remained. We can  recommend Himali and  HHP Tours for all tourists.

I and my wife choosed this guide Arun with a 5-days excursion program of Sri Lanka from this website. It is true Himali is a very good person and fluently speaking Russian. For us helped all the positive previous reviews. Experience and ability to solve problems, he did nicely. We had an uncomfortable time of departure from Colombo at 5am. Himali arranged for us to rest in a good hotel in Hikkaduva, where we spent the evening, rested, bathed in the ocean after a busy last day of sightseeing. At night, the driver Ranil drove us from the hotel to the airport before start registration. By the way, Ranil is also a very nice and very smart guy, he drives a car very carefully. Finally I recommend Himali!
