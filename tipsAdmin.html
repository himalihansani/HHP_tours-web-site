Traveled to Sri Lanka with children in June 2015. Used the services of Miss. Himali (HHP Tours). Everything was professionally. For 5 days I visited Safari in the Yala national Park, tea plantations in the hills of Nuwara Eliya, temple of the Tooth relic in Kandy, climbed ancient Sigiriya and many more interesting places. My kids especially liked rafting, for them it was the first experience of rafting . I recommend an Ayurvedic massage at Habarana where we are on the way  with Himali. Shirodara relieves stress at all, very nice experience. Very good selection of hotels which booked by HHP Tours. It was reasonable price . Anyway, Himali is a great person, our time with her in Sri Lanka was interesting and informative. Thank you!

We would like to grateful tour guide Himali and tour company HHP Tours (Pvt)Ltd. We even two months before planned program of excursion with HHP Tours. We were offered accommodation options, excursions were chosen so that we could see the most interesting and memorable places in this paradise . For 5 days we visited a large number of beautiful places, especially ancient city of Annuradhapura, absolutely not a tourist place with a special atmosphere. I remember the botanical garden in Kandy. On the way we stopped to try the best pineapples, coconuts, mangoes, papayas, passion fruit. The night trek to the "Adam's Peak" left incredible impressions and wonderful photos. Himali very beautifully and fluently speaks Russian language; he is well educated and intelligent. At the end of our long tour we did a city tour in Colombo with Himali. On our next trip to Sri Lanka we will definitely turn to Himali. Thanks again. Alexey and Svetlana , November 2016.

Many thanks, Himali <HHP Tours> for a wonderful vacation. We started planning our trip back in April. Our vacation was on July 2017 and we sent a request to Miss. Himali. Himali responded immediately, we corrected The route, agreed on the price and began to prepare for the vacation. HHP Tours  gave us  good service. The guide Ruvan and the driver  Tushar, who came meet to us, at the sharp time. On the way to Sigiriya, Ruwan explained about lifestyle of Sri Lankan people. He studied in Moscow and speaks nicely Russian. He told funny stories about his life in Russia. As my husband and friends, too, former students of his college, we found many common topics for discus. The driver Tushar was a good and careful driver. On the way we always stopped and they helped to buy all the necessary things. I would like to express my special thanks for organizing the holiday. We are very satisfied with our journey and acquaintance with you. Thank you very much.

We planned a tour of Sri Lanka + Maldives. In Sri Lanka we had only 4.5 days, but as usual during this period I wanted to see everything as much as possible. There were several options, but only Himali arranged quickly answered questions (from the others the answers had to wait for 3-4 days), recommended how to adjust our route in time to see everything planned, and we were satisfied with the cost. His services was great  . I  noted that the punctuality of Himali, he always came on time and even asked us to hurry, because Places a lot and visit everywhere. I noted his excellent knowledge of English, answers all questions, interestingly tells about the country, places visited and history. Well organized tours. As he promised, the car was really comfortable and air-conditioned (it is extremely important). Finally most pleasant impressions of the country and the guide Himali remained. We can  recommend Himali and  HHP Tours for all tourists.

I and my wife choosed this guide Arun with a 5-days excursion program of Sri Lanka from this website. It is true Himali is a very good person and fluently speaking Russian. For us helped all the positive previous reviews. Experience and ability to solve problems, he did nicely. We had an uncomfortable time of departure from Colombo at 5am. Himali arranged for us to rest in a good hotel in Hikkaduva, where we spent the evening, rested, bathed in the ocean after a busy last day of sightseeing. At night, the driver Ranil drove us from the hotel to the airport before start registration. By the way, Ranil is also a very nice and very smart guy, he drives a car very carefully. Finally I recommend Himali!
