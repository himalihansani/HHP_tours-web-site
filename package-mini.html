<b>Kandy</b> - Kandy is a large city in central Sri Lanka. It's set on a plateau surrounded by mountains, which are home to tea plantations and biodiverse rainforest. The city's heart is scenic Kandy Lake (Bogambara Lake), which is popular for strolling. Kandy is famed for sacred Buddhist sites, including the Temple of the Tooth (Sri Dalada Maligawa) shrine, celebrated with the grand Esala Perahera annual procession.<br /><br />

<b>Batik Factory</b> – Batik work is the art of using wax on fabric when dyeing in order to avoid dyeing a certain section of the fabric. This method is also known as wax-resist dyeing.
The material usually used is cotton as it captures the dyes without fading much with use. The wax is dripped in a pattern or design using a spouted tool called a canting, or printed in preset design using a copper stamp called a cap. A stiff brush is used to apply the wax for larger patterns. The material is then immersed in dye and the wax is removed with boiling water afterward. This leaves the waxed area a different color in comparison to the dyed area. The process is repeated with different areas being waxed and dyes of different shades for complex multicolored designs.<br />
The designs are usually very colorful and unique.<br /><br />

<b>Temple of the sacred tooth relic of lord buddha</b> – Sri Dalada Maligawa or the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic is a Buddhist temple in the city of Kandy, Sri Lanka. It is located in the royal palace complex of the former Kingdom of Kandy, which houses the relic of the tooth of the Buddha. Since ancient times, the relic has played an important role in local politics because it is believed that whoever holds the relic holds the governance of the country. Kandy was the last capital of the Sri Lankan kings and is a World Heritage Site mainly due to the temple.<br /><br />

<b>National Dances of Sri Lanka</b> - All forms of dance in Sri Lanka exhibit the lithe graceful movements of dance combined with the vigorous movements, reflecting the complex rhythms of the drum beat. The combination of the shrill melodious strains of music of the flutes and the vibrant drum beat is an ideal back drop to the performers who leap and swirl in frenzied mood of dance.
Sinhalese dance separates neatly into two main kinds of dance with a third kind also: The two main kinds are,<br />
- The up country - (Kandyan) dance <br />
- The low country - (Southern or devil dance) and the third kind is<br />
- The Sabaragamuwa dance.<br />
Although both forms exhibit vigorous moments common to the all dance in Sri Lanka the basic difference is in the manner in which the dancer perform their rituals, which require different dance rhythms and drum beats.

<b>Sigiriya</b> – Sigiriya is an ancient rock fortress located in the northern Matale District near the town of Dambulla in the Central Province, Sri Lanka. The name refers to a site of historical and archaeological significance that is dominated by a massive column of rock nearly 200 metres (660 ft) high. According to the ancient Sri Lankan chronicle the Culavamsa, this site was selected by King Kasyapa (477 – 495 CE) for his new capital. He built his palace on the top of this rock and decorated its sides with colourful frescoes. On a small plateau about halfway up the side of this rock he built a gateway in the form of an enormous lion. The name of this place is derived from this structure —Sīhāgiri, the Lion Rock. The capital and the royal palace was abandoned after the king's death. It was used as a Buddhist monastery until the 14th century.<br />
Sigiriya today is a UNESCO listed World Heritage Site. It is one of the best preserved examples of ancient urban planning

An interactive demo educated travelers on the process used to transform raw stones into delicate pieces that are placed in gold or platinum settings. While visitors say this is one of the best place to stock up on stones, those in the know warn it’s essential to know the ins and outs of gems to avoid steep prices for less than precious stones.<br /><br />



<b>Tea Plantation</b> - The leaves that go into a cup of Ceylon tea play a surprisingly complex role in the history of Sri Lanka.<br />
It started with a single camellia sinesis plant brought from China in 1824 by the British, who had colonized the island then known as Ceylon in 1801.<br />
The plant was to be displayed in the Royal Botanical Gardens outside Kandy in the country's lush interior -- but it has since grown into a $1.5 billion export business for the teardrop shaped island nation off India's southern tip.<br />
Alongside the agricultural production of tea, which accounts for 2.5% of the country's $60 billion GDP, tea tourism is also emerging as a popular experience for travelers.
In 1867 Scottish coffee planter James Taylor, the man who would be recognized as the pioneer of Sri Lanka's tea industry, planted 19 acres of tea near Kandy at an altitude of around 500 meters.<br />
In the 1860s, however, Sri Lanka was the world's largest coffee producer and few paid attention to Taylor. Two years later came the first seeds of change when Hemileia vastatrix, or coffee rust, was detected on the island.<br /><br />


<b>Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage</b> – Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage; just as the name suggests holds a unique disposition in the ex-situ animal care. It’s success and fame has travelled not just within the country but throughout the world to an extent where Pinnawala synonymous with the Sri Lankan Elephant.<br /><br />
